The objective was to design a dynamic points scoring system that incentivizes or penalizes player actions based on activity levels, while ensuring the total score remains strictly under the threshold of 4 * 10‚Å∂. 

The notebook contains detailed simulations, modeling realistic player behavior, which were used to rigorously test and optimize the system.

Below is a comparison result of this system vs the old version
